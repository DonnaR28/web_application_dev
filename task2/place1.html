    <p>Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an outstanding combination of size and aesthetics. Construction took over a period of ten years, from 1638 to 1648. When the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, came to Delhi shifting his capital from Agra to Delhi, the fort was his idea of residence. It was then famous as the Qila-e-Mubarak. The octagonal fort, built in red sandstone, stands proudly amid the din and commotion of Old Delhi. It draws visitors in great numbers every day.
