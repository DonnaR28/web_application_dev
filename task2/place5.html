    <p>Fatehpur Sikri, situated at a distance of almost 40km to the west of Agra, was the short-lived capital of the Mughal emperor Akbar. It served as a short lived capital of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. However, it had to be abandoned because of problems with the water supply, among other things. Taking a tour of this royal city brings you across courtyards, audience halls and pavilions that reflect the artistic excellence achieved during the heyday of the Mughal Empire.
